# The Interactive Machine Learning Paradigm
The Interactive Machine Learning (IML) paradigm is a machine learning training scheme that allows a model to be trained to perform a specific task alongside a human expert who performs the same task. This repository contains code that implements the IML pipeline, application to the tasks of Voice-Type Discrimination (VTD) and Language Identification (LID), as well as many plotting, scoring, and feature extraction scripts.

## Dependencies
Dependencies are contained in the `requirements.txt` file. To equip your virtual environment with these dependencies, start a virtual environment with Python 3.9 installed and run the command

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Additional configuration of Pytorch for your machine may be required.

## Demonstration
### VTD Example

### LID Example--African Continent

### LID Example--Caucasus Region
